### Setting Up the Environment

Before we start building our neural network, we need to set up our environment and install the necessary libraries. Follow these instructions to get everything set up:

#### Step 1: Install Python

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. We recommend using Python 3.6 or higher. You can download Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

#### Step 2: Install Anaconda (Optional but Recommended)

Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of Python and R, which makes it easy to manage libraries and dependencies. It comes with a package manager called `conda` and many pre-installed data science libraries.

Download and install Anaconda from the official [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

#### Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment

Creating a virtual environment helps to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named 'deep_learning_env'
conda create --name deep_learning_env python=3.8

# Activate the virtual environment
conda activate deep_learning_env
```

If you're not using Anaconda, you can create a virtual environment using `venv`:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named 'deep_learning_env'
python -m venv deep_learning_env

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
deep_learning_env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source deep_learning_env/bin/activate
```

#### Step 4: Install Necessary Libraries

With the virtual environment activated, install the necessary libraries using `pip`:

```bash
# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install Keras and TensorFlow
pip install keras tensorflow

# Install additional libraries
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

#### Step 5: Verify the Installation

To verify that everything is installed correctly, open a Python interpreter by running `python` in your terminal and execute the following commands:

```python
import keras
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sklearn

print("Keras version:", keras.__version__)
print("TensorFlow version:", tf.__version__)
print("NumPy version:", np.__version__)
print("Pandas version:", pd.__version__)
print("Matplotlib version:", plt.__version__)
print("Scikit-learn version:", sklearn.__version__)
```

If there are no errors and the versions are printed, you have successfully set up your environment.

#### Step 6: Set Up a Jupyter Notebook (Optional)

If you prefer working in a Jupyter Notebook, you can install Jupyter and create a new notebook:

```bash
# Install Jupyter
pip install jupyter

# Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
```

In the Jupyter Notebook interface, you can create a new Python 3 notebook and start coding.

You are now ready to start building your neural network with Keras! Let's move on to the next step: preparing the data.
